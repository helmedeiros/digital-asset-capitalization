refactor(assets): remove contribution types from assets

This commit removes contribution types from assets as they belong to tasks:

- Remove ContributionTypes field from Asset model
- Remove contribution type related errors and constants
- Remove contribution type command from CLI
- Remove contribution type related tests
- Update show command to not display contribution types

The changes reflect that contribution types are a property of tasks, not assets.
