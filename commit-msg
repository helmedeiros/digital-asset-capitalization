feat(assets): add show command for detailed asset information

This commit adds a new command to show detailed information about assets:

- Add 'show' command under assets to display asset details
- Show asset name, description, creation/update times, and task count
- Display contribution types if present
- Add comprehensive tests for the show functionality
- Handle error cases for non-existent assets

The show command allows users to:

1. View detailed information about a specific asset
2. See when the asset was created and last updated
3. Check the current task count
4. View all contribution types assigned to the asset
