refactor(tasks): replace TaskFetcher with TaskRepository in ClassifyTasksUseCase

This change improves the codebase by:
1. Removing the redundant TaskFetcher interface and implementation
2. Using TaskRepository consistently throughout the codebase
3. Simplifying the dependency injection by using a single interface
4. Making the code more maintainable by reducing interface duplication

The changes include:
- Updating ClassifyTasksUseCase to use remoteRepo instead of taskFetcher
- Removing TaskFetcher interface and its implementations
- Updating tests to reflect the new dependency structure
- Modifying service initialization to use only repositories
