fix: resolve linting issues and improve code quality

This commit addresses several code quality issues identified by the linter:

- Fix shadowed error variables in cmd/main_test.go and classify_tasks.go
- Replace deprecated io/ioutil with io package in jira_adapter.go
- Pre-allocate slices for better performance:
  - tasks slice in jira/client.go
  - result slice in json_repository.go
- Remove unnecessary string conversion in assets service
- Use environment variable constants in jira config
- Fix unused variables and functions

All tests are passing with 78% code coverage. These changes improve code maintainability,
performance, and follow Go best practices without changing the core functionality.
